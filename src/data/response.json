Some of these men still own their yachts, while others have sold them, but all have left their mark on the world of superyacht design and construction.</p>\n<h2><em>OCTOPUS</em> AND <em>TATOOSH</em></h2>\n<figure><a href=\"http://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/octopus-1k.jpg\"><img alt=\"<span class=\"default-blue\">One of the 20 largest yachts in the world, Octopus is Paul Allen's latest ride.</span>\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"3986843165\" src=\"https://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/octopus-1k.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption>One of the 20 largest yachts in the world, Octopus is Paul Allen&rsquo;s latest ride.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Paul Allen, after co-founding Microsoft with Bill Gates, has gone on to have a wide-ranging career that includes everything from owning the NBA&rsquo;s Portland Trail Blazers to founding the Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He&rsquo;s also a well-known figure in the world&rsquo;s superyachting circles, thanks to several motoryachts he has owned over the years. Currently, he owns the 413-foot Lurssen <em>Octopus</em> (one of the 20 largest yachts in the world) as well as the 303-foot Nobiskrug <em>Tatoosh</em> (one of the 50 largest yachts in the world).</p>\n<p><em>Octopus</em> reportedly has not one, but two helicopters; a submarine; a swimming pool; a music studio and a basketball court. The yacht can regularly be seen at the Cannes Film Festival, held each May on the French Riviera, where Allen throws parties for several hundred people&mdash;whom he entertains by playing with his own band. Allen also enjoys using <em>Octopus</em> for exploration, including having helped to find the remains of a Japanese warship that went down during World War II.</p>\n<p>Allen bought <em>Tatoosh</em> on the brokerage market (reportedly for about $100 million). <em>Tatoosh</em>, too, has a swimming pool, one that is nearly six feet deep with a floor that rises to become flush with the deck when the yacht is underway. As of a few years ago, <em>Tatoosh</em> also reportedly had a lobster tank in her lazarette.</p>\n<h2><em>RISING SUN </em>AND<em> MUSASHI</em></h2>\n<figure><a href=\"http://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/rising-sun-1k.jpg\"><img alt=\"<span class=\"default-blue\">Music and entertainment mogul David Geffen owns her now, but the 453-foot Lurssen Rising Sun was originally commissioned for Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., who has since downsized to the 287-foot Feadship Musashi.</span>\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"1889199731\" src=\"https://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/rising-sun-1k.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption>Music and entertainment mogul David Geffen owns her now, but the 453-foot Lurssen Rising Sun was originally commissioned for Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., who has since downsized to the 287-foot Feadship Musashi.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Rising Sun</em> remains one of the most jaw-dropping superyachts on the world&rsquo;s waters today. She reportedly accommodates 18 guests with 45 crew, while <em>Musashi</em> takes the same number of guests with 24 crew. Because of her smaller length overall, <em>Musashi</em> can fit into ports where <em>Rising Sun</em> could not&mdash;one of the prime reasons that Ellison chose to go smaller.</p>\n<p>Ellison is perhaps best known for his Oracle Racing efforts to dominate the America&rsquo;s Cup, which his team will defend in July 2017 during races off Bermuda. He has transformed the America&rsquo;s Cup in many ways, including by pushing for changes in the types of yachts that are allowed to race, leading to today&rsquo;s foiling catamarans that seem to fly high above the water at speeds that were unimaginable to traditional-yacht skippers of races past.</p>\n<h2><em>FOUNTAINHEAD</em></h2>\n<figure><a href=\"http://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/fountainhead-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"<span class=\"default-blue\">Technically Mark Cuban isn't based in Silicon Valley, but much of his fortune comes from the tech world, and he reportedly owns the 288-foot Feadship Fountainhead—a sistership to Larry Ellison's Musashi.</span> Photo by Phillip Pessar.\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"110377881\" src=\"https://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/fountainhead-1.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption>Technically Mark Cuban isn&rsquo;t based in Silicon Valley, but much of his fortune comes from the tech world, and he reportedly owns the 288-foot Feadship Fountainhead&mdash;a sistership to Larry Ellison&rsquo;s Musashi. Photo by Phillip Pessar.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><em>Fountainhead </em>is a presence in every harbor she enters. Before becoming a household name thanks to the television show &ldquo;Shark Tank,&rdquo; Cuban sold personal-computer software and founded a business called MicroSolutions that CompuServe bought for $6 million. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">He got into webcasting and sold a company called Broadcast.com to Yahoo! for $5.7 billion, co-founded a company specializing in high-definition satellite television and dabbles in everything from web-based basketball scouting technology to blogosphere-scouring search engine technology.</span></span></span></p>\n<p>Cuban may be extroverted when it comes to his television and celebrity appearances, but with <em>Fountainhead</em>, he keeps details to himself. <span class=\"default-blue\">The yacht reportedly has interiors by Sinot Yacht Design, accommodations for 14 guests and a top speed of 21 knots.</span></p>\n<h2><em>VENUS</em></h2>\n<figure><a href=\"http://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/venus-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"<span class=\"default-blue\">Feadship built the 256-foot Venus for Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, but he died before she could be delivered.</span> <span class=\"default-blue\">His widow, Laurene Powell Jobs, is now listed as the owner of Venus.</span>\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"3346796890\" src=\"https://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/venus-1.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption>Feadship built the 256-foot Venus for Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, but he died before she could be delivered.

With that spat now reportedly resolved, <em>Venus</em> continues to be seen on the world&rsquo;s waters, where she is a distinctive presence thanks to Starck&rsquo;s unique approach to exterior styling. The designer himself has been quoted as saying that <em>Venus</em> &ldquo;looks strange for a boat,&rdquo; adding that the yacht&rsquo;s appearance is a result of Jobs wanting to focus on intelligent design as opposed to an ostentatious display of wealth. Little is known about the interior of <em>Venus</em>, but rumors have circulated that a series of iMac computers grace the pilothouse.</p>\n<h2><em>DRAGONFLY</em></h2>\n<figure><a href=\"http://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/dragonfly-1k.jpg\"><img alt=\"<span class=\"default-blue\">Sergei Brin, a co-founder of Google, reportedly owns the 240-foot Hanseatic Marine Dragonfly, which originally launched as Silver Zwei.</span>\" data-pagespeed-url-hash=\"892879328\" src=\"https://features.boats.com/boat-content/files/2016/09/dragonfly-1k.jpg\"></img></a><figcaption>Sergei Brin, a co-founder of Google, reportedly owns the 240-foot Hanseatic Marine Dragonfly, which originally launched as Silver Zwei.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Espen Oino designed Dragonfly to be built in lightweight aluminum, which gives her a top speed of 27 knots and a fuel efficiency that allows a range of 4,500 nautical miles at slower speeds&mdash;enough to explore wherever owner Sergei Brin might feel like exploring, anywhere in the world that interests him.</p>\n<p>Brin reportedly bought <em>Dragonfly</em> following her being listed for sale at $85 million. At one point, <em>Dragonfly</em> was available for charter, being marketed in the Bahamas and Caribbean back in 2011 at a weekly base rate of about $525,000. <span class=\"default-blue\">She reportedly accommodates 18 guests with 16 crew.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> This article originally appeared on YachtWorld.com.

Gates&rsquo;s wealth then slumped with the dot-com bubble burst, and he regained the title of centibillionaire only in 2019.

Last week we put together <a href=\"https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/startup-quotes-inspiration/\">19 quotes from some of the best minds in the technology world</a>, and to continue to inspire you this summer, we&rsquo;ve now grouped <strong>5 founder and investor video interviews</strong> that will keep you busy for a couple of hours. There are a ton of interviews out there with founders, CEOs and investors, but we&rsquo;ve taken the time to select 5 that we consider very relevant and of high quality. Let&rsquo;s jump right into it!</p>\n<h2>Jack Dorsey: perseverance pays off</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQy_HFHOZug\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s fingerprints are all over the place in recent years. <span class=\"default-blue\">He was part of the original team that built Twitter while working at podcasting company Odeo and, after being fired as CEO of Twitter, he went to co-found another billion dollar startup, Square.</span></p>\n<p>The interview above with Kevin Rose is one of Dorsey&rsquo;s best and, although he does not talk about all of the issues that took place inside Twitter while trying to transform the startup into a big company -for more details on that read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591846013\">Hatching Twitter</a>&ndash; he does go into detail about his childhood, how his passion for maps and urban city helped him come up with the idea of Twitter and how a variety of other situations helped him build <a href=\"https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/fintech-startups-europe/\">payments</a> company Square. Dorsey&rsquo;s has had its up and downs during his career, but if there&rsquo;s one thing we can learn from him is that <strong>perseverance pays off in the long run</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Fred Wilson: corporate VCs suck</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-gaG7iTBIw\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">Fred Wilson has become one of the most legendary venture capitalists in the US.</span> He co-founded NYC-based <a href=\"http://www.usv.com/\">Union Square Ventures</a> in the 90s and since then he&rsquo;s invested in some of the fastest growing startups out of Silicon Valley and New York City: Twitter, Zynga, Foursquare, Tumblr, etsy, etc. Wilson regularly shares his thoughts on the venture capital and technology industry on his blog, <a href=\"http://avc.com/\">avc</a>, and he&rsquo;s algo been interviewed a number of times at various events and conferences. However, the above with Sarah Lacy from Pando is probably on his best.</p>\n<p>For an hour and a half Wilson discusses the changes happening in the VC industry, his experience and his legacy. Oh, and also why <strong>he does not like to co-invest with corporate VCs</strong>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never invest with corporate VCs again. Never, ever, ever again. Because they suck. They&rsquo;re not interested in the company or entrepreneur success, they&rsquo;re interested in their own success and they suck at investing. There are exceptions like Intel and Google, but most of the rest suck&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs: compete and cooperate</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvhW8cp15tk\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The technology industry, in many ways, it&rsquo;s ultra competitive. Startups fight against each other to become market leaders in their areas and to control the profits. However, this does not mean that technology companies can&rsquo;t help each other and cooperate. One of the best examples of this was Microsoft&rsquo;s $150 million investment in Apple, when the company founded by Steve Jobs was struggling and on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">At the AllThingsD conference, Jobs and Gates were interviewed by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg and looked back on the 80s and 90s, when both Apple and Microsoft were starting to become a force in the market.</span> Should companies compete against each other ferociously? No doubt. <strong>Can they also help each other and cooperate in favor of the market and consumers? Also possible.</strong></p>\n<h2>Martin Varsavsky: life-work balance</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB10ilqE6sw\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">Born in Argentina, grew up in New York and developed his professional career in Madrid, Spain.</span> <span class=\"default-blue\">The story of Martin Varsavsky is full of changes and interesting anecdotes, and his success at building massive companies such as Jazztel or Ya.com once again demonstrate that immigrants tend to be among the most successful entrepreneurs.</span> Since 2005 he&rsquo;s embarked in a new adventure, Fon, a Madrid-based company that wants to become the biggest WiFi network in the world. However, life is not only about work and Varsavsky has said so a number of times in the past few years.</p>\n<p>In the above presentation that he gave at LeWeb London 2012, the Argentinian-turned-Spaniard shares a variety of tips and recommendations from <strong>those who want to work better and, in the meantime, have a better life</strong>. Quick tip from from: don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the recommendation of owning your own plane. Achieving that is not an easy task.</p>\n<h2>Sergei Brin and Larry Page: long term vision</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wdnp_7atZ0M\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>This one is very recent. It&rsquo;s not easy to see Sergei Brin and Larry Page share the stage for an interview, but they did so in the summer of 2014 at the KV Summit, a conference led by venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. It&rsquo;s not a long interview and very easy to digest, but Bring and Page talk about something that most people know about Google but that has not been made public many times in the past: <strong>the company&rsquo;s long term vision</strong>. Both co-founders claim that, contrary to most other technology companies, they have the luxury of working on a long term vision, thinking 10 to 20 years ahead instead of the usual four. Can other companies do this? The bigger ones do. Do they all do it? Unfortunately not.</p>",

But unless one is deeply familiar with the nuts and bolts of the budgeting process, it is not easy to understand what the trade-offs were and why certain calls were made.</p>\n<p>It is also the case that, for us average punters, the numbers are pretty much meaningless. A billion here; a billion there, what does it all mean? We don&rsquo;t know if this is an increase or a decrease from the current baseline; what fraction of Crown revenue does this represent and what does the increase in spending in one area mean for spending in another?It is also the case that the budgeting process for a small open economy in the middle of the South Pacific is not easy since we are seldom the masters of our own destiny. A lot will depend on what happens to our trade with China or the US, which in turn depends on how those economies rebound from the pandemic.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>My fear is that the authors of the current budget are not only worrying about three decades old wrongs but are trying to address them with three decades old thinking. <span class=\"default-blue\">Three decades ago, 'Googling' had not become a verb; China was still a relatively poor country; the massive off-shoring of jobs was still to come; Amazon was still a river in South America.</span></p> </blockquote>\n<p>So, we pontificate on the basis of our own perspective; we talk up those things that we like and disdain those that we do not. So, having said that and with a due mea culpa for my own pontificating, here are few thoughts that have come to mind following on from Budget 2021.</p>\n<p>First off, a budget needs to be understood as an aspirational document that sets out our priorities and goals. Given that this is the case, surely there is something wrong with a budget that starts out with the explicit purpose of correcting three decade old wrongs. This does not mean that those old inequities should not be addressed, but my fear is that the authors of the current budget are not only worrying about three decade old wrongs but are trying to address them with three decade old thinking.</p>\n<p>(And remember, three decades ago, there was no iPhone or iPad; &ldquo;Googling&rdquo; had not become a verb; China was still a relatively poor country; the massive off-shoring of jobs was still to come; Amazon was still a river in South America and social media did not exist.)</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think? <a href=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/bringing-the-next-sergey-brin-to-nz\">Click here to comment.</a></strong></p>\n<p>Let me give an example of what I mean. The New Zealand government talks a lot about climate change. General Motors has just announced that by 2035 (in 14 years&rsquo; time) they will only produce electric vehicles. It is likely that most other car makers will follow suit. Let us suppose that, in short order, all Kiwis start driving electric cars. Can our current electric grid support this? If not, then is this not something that should be a priority?</p>\n<p>The Finance Minister has made a big deal of saying that Crown debt that was supposed to exceed 50 percent in about three years&rsquo; time will be held down to a lower proportion. Why? Japan&rsquo;s debt is more than 200 percent of its GDP. There are other countries like Greece with debt standing at more than 100 percent of GDP.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">If it was fine to effectively quadruple debt in three to four years from its pre-pandemic level, then why the sudden pusillanimity?</span></span> Having run up that debt, why not invest in large infrastructure projects and industries with large value added?</p>\n<p>Currently two of our biggest export industries, tourism and higher education, are on their knees. What is the thinking here? That one fine day we will open up our borders and things will go right back to where they were? This is highly unlikely to happen. For one thing many airlines have re-routed their existing flights so if and when we open up there will be far fewer options and consequently higher prices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">The Government seems to believe that New Zealand will become this Covid-free haven where everyone, tourists, workers and students will want to come.</span> This seems far-fetched. By the end of 2021, most countries in the world will be Covid-free. If I am a skilled worker or student located overseas and I am looking to emigrate, will New Zealand be a priority for me?</p>\n<p>I would be thinking: should I emigrate to a small country with a small market in the middle of the South Pacific? What if I get stuck there without a job when the next pandemic hits? Or am I better off looking at some of the bigger countries and markets in North America or Western Europe, which offer greater mobility and job prospects?</p>\n<p>Already there is evidence that international students are moving away from Australia to the UK. The same is most likely true, and probably to a greater extent, for New Zealand.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Governments cannot figure out who the next Sergey Brin will be; what they can do is make it easy for talented people to come to the country and leave them alone to build the next Google.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">In per capita GDP terms, New Zealand is already one of the poorer of the OECD countries with a per capita GDP that is close to the OECD average and comparable to South Korea and the Czech Republic.</span> Can New Zealand sustain a first world lifestyle on the basis of primary products exports and without skilled migrants?</p>\n<p>Yes, the Chinese economy is growing rapidly. But unless China manages to establish democracy it will never achieve the economic vibrancy of the US or Western Europe. Why? Simply because the best minds of the world migrate to those latter countries with new ideas and new optimism.</p>\n<p>The vast bulk of Silicon Valley start-ups were started by migrants to the US. None of these people will consider heading to China. And Japan, once an enterprising pioneer, has been in decline for a long time now.</p>\n<p>With increasing global connectivity, a stable, non-corrupt and crime-free society, why should New Zealand not be able to attract some of this talent particularly in the service sector? Governments cannot figure out who the next Sergey Brin will be; what they can do is make it easy for talented people to come to the country and leave them alone to build the next Google.</p>\n<p>It is not clear that the Government understands these challenges or how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>Help us create a sustainable future for independent local journalism</p>\n<p>As New Zealand moves from crisis to recovery mode the need to support local industry has been brought into sharp relief.</p>\n<p>As our journalists work to ask the hard questions about our recovery, we also look to you, our readers for support.

But unless one is deeply familiar with the nuts and bolts of the budgeting process, it is not easy to understand what the trade-offs were and why certain calls were made.</p>\n<p>It is also the case that, for us average punters, the numbers are pretty much meaningless. A billion here; a billion there, what does it all mean? We don&rsquo;t know if this is an increase or a decrease from the current baseline; what fraction of Crown revenue does this represent and what does the increase in spending in one area mean for spending in another?It is also the case that the budgeting process for a small open economy in the middle of the South Pacific is not easy since we are seldom the masters of our own destiny. A lot will depend on what happens to our trade with China or the US, which in turn depends on how those economies rebound from the pandemic.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>My fear is that the authors of the current budget are not only worrying about three decades old wrongs but are trying to address them with three decades old thinking. <span class=\"default-blue\">Three decades ago, 'Googling' had not become a verb; China was still a relatively poor country; the massive off-shoring of jobs was still to come; Amazon was still a river in South America.</span></p> </blockquote>\n<p>So, we pontificate on the basis of our own perspective; we talk up those things that we like and disdain those that we do not. So, having said that and with a due mea culpa for my own pontificating, here are few thoughts that have come to mind following on from Budget 2021.</p>\n<p>First off, a budget needs to be understood as an aspirational document that sets out our priorities and goals. Given that this is the case, surely there is something wrong with a budget that starts out with the explicit purpose of correcting three decade old wrongs. This does not mean that those old inequities should not be addressed, but my fear is that the authors of the current budget are not only worrying about three decade old wrongs but are trying to address them with three decade old thinking.</p>\n<p>(And remember, three decades ago, there was no iPhone or iPad; &ldquo;Googling&rdquo; had not become a verb; China was still a relatively poor country; the massive off-shoring of jobs was still to come; Amazon was still a river in South America and social media did not exist.)</p>\n<p><strong>What do you think? <a href=\"https://www.newsroom.co.nz/bringing-the-next-sergey-brin-to-nz\">Click here to comment.</a></strong></p>\n<p>Let me give an example of what I mean. The New Zealand government talks a lot about climate change. General Motors has just announced that by 2035 (in 14 years&rsquo; time) they will only produce electric vehicles. It is likely that most other car makers will follow suit. Let us suppose that, in short order, all Kiwis start driving electric cars. Can our current electric grid support this? If not, then is this not something that should be a priority?</p>\n<p>The Finance Minister has made a big deal of saying that Crown debt that was supposed to exceed 50 percent in about three years&rsquo; time will be held down to a lower proportion. Why? Japan&rsquo;s debt is more than 200 percent of its GDP. There are other countries like Greece with debt standing at more than 100 percent of GDP.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">If it was fine to effectively quadruple debt in three to four years from its pre-pandemic level, then why the sudden pusillanimity?</span></span> Having run up that debt, why not invest in large infrastructure projects and industries with large value added?</p>\n<p>Currently two of our biggest export industries, tourism and higher education, are on their knees. What is the thinking here? That one fine day we will open up our borders and things will go right back to where they were? This is highly unlikely to happen. For one thing many airlines have re-routed their existing flights so if and when we open up there will be far fewer options and consequently higher prices.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">The Government seems to believe that New Zealand will become this Covid-free haven where everyone, tourists, workers and students will want to come.</span> This seems far-fetched. By the end of 2021, most countries in the world will be Covid-free. If I am a skilled worker or student located overseas and I am looking to emigrate, will New Zealand be a priority for me?</p>\n<p>I would be thinking: should I emigrate to a small country with a small market in the middle of the South Pacific? What if I get stuck there without a job when the next pandemic hits? Or am I better off looking at some of the bigger countries and markets in North America or Western Europe, which offer greater mobility and job prospects?</p>\n<p>Already there is evidence that international students are moving away from Australia to the UK. The same is most likely true, and probably to a greater extent, for New Zealand.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Governments cannot figure out who the next Sergey Brin will be; what they can do is make it easy for talented people to come to the country and leave them alone to build the next Google.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">In per capita GDP terms, New Zealand is already one of the poorer of the OECD countries with a per capita GDP that is close to the OECD average and comparable to South Korea and the Czech Republic.</span> Can New Zealand sustain a first world lifestyle on the basis of primary products exports and without skilled migrants?</p>\n<p>Yes, the Chinese economy is growing rapidly. But unless China manages to establish democracy it will never achieve the economic vibrancy of the US or Western Europe. Why? Simply because the best minds of the world migrate to those latter countries with new ideas and new optimism.</p>\n<p>The vast bulk of Silicon Valley start-ups were started by migrants to the US. None of these people will consider heading to China. And Japan, once an enterprising pioneer, has been in decline for a long time now.</p>\n<p>With increasing global connectivity, a stable, non-corrupt and crime-free society, why should New Zealand not be able to attract some of this talent particularly in the service sector? Governments cannot figure out who the next Sergey Brin will be; what they can do is make it easy for talented people to come to the country and leave them alone to build the next Google.</p>\n<p>It is not clear that the Government understands these challenges or how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>Help us create a sustainable future for independent local journalism</p>\n<p>As New Zealand moves from crisis to recovery mode the need to support local industry has been brought into sharp relief.</p>\n<p>As our journalists work to ask the hard questions about our recovery, we also look to you, our readers for support.

                  "html": "<p>Every year we talk to hundreds of parents who are looking for the right private school for their child. Many of them have heard about Montessori and are interested in learning how it can help their child develop the skills they need to succeed in life. There are, however, some questions that come up over and over again about the Montessori method and how it works in the classroom setting.</p>\n<p>If you're trying to decide if a Montessori school is right for your child, read on. Below we separate fact from fiction.</p>\n<h2><span class=\"default-blue\">Montessori Criticism Debunked: 9 Incorrect Assumptions about Student Centered Learning</span></h2>\n<h3>Criticism #1: Montessori classrooms are chaotic.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: Montessori classrooms are often busy, noisy places, but all that movement and noise represents productive and purposeful activity. Students are busily engaged in <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/inquiry-based-learning\">inquiry based learning</a> projects, sharing their interest as well as their insights. Instead of sitting at desks all day, children move around and talk with their peers as they work together to learn.</p>\n<p>This active, busy classroom setting helps children in a number of ways. They can collaborate and learn from their peers. They can move around instead of sitting still for long periods of time. They can also use the space and pick the learning tools that best match their individual <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/passionforlearning/auditory-visual-and-kinesthetic-helping-children-succeed-through-different-learning-styles\">learning styles</a>, whether that&rsquo;s from handling the classroom materials, reading about them, taking notes or making sketches.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #2: In Montessori classrooms, there is no curriculum to follow.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: It is true that the children in <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/student-centered-learning\">student centered learning</a> programs do have a lot more freedom to choose their own activities, but Montessori classrooms still have a schedule to follow and structure which guides and focuses the children&rsquo;s activities throughout the day.</p>\n<p>At Whitby, we have a curriculum beginning at 18 months in our Montessori program. <span class=\"default-blue\">We layer the International Baccalaureate program on top of Montessori so that students explore learning in overarching units of inquiry.</span> As part of the curriculum, Montessori teachers prepare the range of activities available to the children. While each child can choose the activity they find most interesting on a given day, all of the activities available present valuable learning opportunities. Whichever activity the child chooses to participate in, they will be learning the information they need to succeed in school.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #3: Montessori and unschooling are the same.</h3>\n<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> While both the Montessori education and unschooling are focused around a child-led education, there are key differences between the two philosophies. Montessori schools recognize that while student centered learning is the best way to interest and engage children in their education, they still benefit from structure and a defined curriculum. The unschooling method, on the other hand, lets a child choose which subjects to learn and which to ignore.</p>\n<p>To become a Montessori educator, teachers have to undergo extensive training in the methods, while the parent is usually in charge of their child&rsquo;s education in unschooling. Montessori schools also give students opportunities to collaborate with their peers every day, while children undergoing unschooling have fewer chances to practice their social skills. Read more about the differences between Montessori and <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/passionforlearning/5-key-differences-between-montessori-and-unschooling\">unschooling</a>.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #4: The children in Montessori classrooms don&rsquo;t get grades or take tests.</h3>\n<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> While it&rsquo;s true that Montessori students aren&rsquo;t given grades in the traditional sense, their progress is still carefully monitored. Teachers observe each student to assess how that student is progressing and when they will be ready to move on to more challenging work. Parents are kept apprised of their children&rsquo;s progress, and students assess their own progress, as well. Montessori schools also offer test preparation programs to make sure students are ready to succeed as they move on to secondary school.</p>\n<p>The reason Montessori schools don&rsquo;t focus on traditional grades is because that teaches students to learn only for the sake of the grade. The goal is instead to help students develop a love of learning so learning itself motivates them.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #5: The Montessori method is only for preschoolers.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: Maria Montessori <a href=\"http://amshq.org/Montessori-Education/History-of-Montessori-Education/Early-History-of-Montessori\">originally designed</a> her teaching concepts to be used at the preschool level. She felt that the student centered learning model worked well with the natural inquisitiveness of young children as they started to learn and put them on the best path of success as they entered more traditional learning settings.</p>\n<p>But in the 1920s, she expanded the program to include older children and adolescents, emphasizing their need to grow into caring, socially-aware adults. At Whitby, our Montessori program is blended with the <a href=\"http://link\">IB program</a> through second grade and our classes are focused around student centered learning principles through eighth grade. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/student-centered-learning\">student centered learning</a> at Whitby.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #6: There are no rules in a Montessori classroom.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: While children in a Montessori classroom decide which activities interest them most at a given time, the classroom still has rules that all students must follow. Montessori classrooms emphasize that self-discipline and respect for the other students in the class are an important part of learning.</p>\n<p>Children discover that by respecting others, they earn the independence they crave to explore and learn in the classroom setting.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #7: Children from Montessori programs aren&rsquo;t ready for real schools and real life.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: If professional success is a yardstick parents use to evaluate an educational program, the exact opposite is true. Renowned chef Julia Child, business expert Peter Drucker, magician David Blaine, singer Beyonc&eacute; Knowles, music producer Sean Combs and Pulitzer prize-winning author Katharine Graham were all Montessori graduates. Google founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/ideas-market/2011/04/05/the-montessori-mafia/\"> directly attribute their success</a> to their early Montessori education.</p>\n<blockquote> <p>&ldquo;Montessori taught me the joy of discovery. It&rsquo;s all about learning on your terms, rather than a teacher explaining stuff to you. SimCity comes right out of Montessori&hellip;&rdquo;<br><span class=\"default-blue\">- Will Wright, inventor of the Sims video game series.</span></p> </blockquote>\n<p>At Whitby, our students go on to attend <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/secondary-school-accepts-matriculations\">top high schools around</a> New England and beyond, including Phillips Andover Academy, Brunswick School, Peddie School, and Greens Farms Academy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"default-blue\">Criticism #8: Montessori classrooms are confusing because they have students of different ages.</span></h3>\n<p>The Reality: Multi-age classrooms are actually a benefit of the Montessori method. Maria Montessori observed that younger children learn best from watching their older peers. <span class=\"default-blue\">She also saw that older children learn empathy as they mentor younger students and help others with the lessons they have already mastered.</span></p>\n<p>We see this happen everyday at Whitby with students in our <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/private-elementary-school\">private elementary school</a>. In grades one and two, Whitby students learn in multi-age classrooms. Instead of chaos, the multi-age classroom gives younger children role models and gives older children opportunities to become leaders.</p>\n<h3>Criticism #9: Montessori classrooms are just fun and games.</h3>\n<p>The Reality: It&rsquo;s true. Montessori classrooms are fun, but that is a good thing. There are many studies that confirm that <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/passionforlearning/how-do-children-learn-through-play\">children learn through play</a>. The playful attitudes in Montessori classrooms in the very thing that focuses our students&rsquo; attention and helps them learn so successfully.</p>\n<p>Think about it. From the moment your child was born, they were fascinated by the world around them. You did not have to encourage them to reach out and grab toys, learn how to walk, or learn how to talk. They wanted to interact with their world through play, and learning was the natural outcome. There is no reason this natural connection between play and learning cannot continue into the school years.</p>\n<p>At Whitby, we include opportunities for children to play in the curriculum. We tie together all the subjects that are covered in a normal school in creative ways that help students gain a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; understanding of concepts.</p>\n<h2>We believe the Montessori method creates the ideal learning environment.</h2>\n<p>At Whitby, we&rsquo;ve found that the Montessori method helps children develop into creative, responsible students who love learning. By addressing how children learn in their own way and encouraging children to collaborate with their peers, we are able to help them develop a greater understanding of the world around them.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering have more questions or are wondering if a <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/montessori-preschool\">Montessori preschool</a> is right for your child, please <a href=\"https://www.whitbyschool.org/schedule-a-tour\">schedule a tour</a> of Whitby. We&rsquo;d love to show you how we combine our Montessori Early Years program with the International Baccalaureate to create an innovative learning environment.</p>",

Gates&rsquo;s wealth then slumped with the dot-com bubble burst, and he regained the title of centibillionaire only in 2019. Tesla Inc.&rsquo;s Elon Musk and Facebook Inc.&rsquo;s Mark Zuckerberg joined the club last year as the tech industry led a boost in wealth creation with the coronavirus pandemic accelerating a switch to online.</p>\n<p>Billionaires with wealth of at least $100 billion are mostly U.S.-based.

The tech-focused Nasdaq 100 Index has risen more than 7% this year, with Google parent Alphabet Inc. rallying for the past two weeks as it won a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/supreme-court-overturns-oracle-s-copyright-win-over-google\">copyright ruling</a>. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">Page and Brin have added more than $20 billion each to their wealth this year, some of the biggest gains.</span></span></p>\n<p>Warren Buffett briefly reached the $100 billion mark in March before hitting it again last week, while Bernard Arnault of France&rsquo;s luxury group LVMH has been part of the elite group on and off since 2019.</p>\n<p><em>&mdash; With assistance by Benjamin Stupples</em></p>",

Last week we put together <a href=\"https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/startup-quotes-inspiration/\">19 quotes from some of the best minds in the technology world</a>, and to continue to inspire you this summer, we&rsquo;ve now grouped <strong>5 founder and investor video interviews</strong> that will keep you busy for a couple of hours. There are a ton of interviews out there with founders, CEOs and investors, but we&rsquo;ve taken the time to select 5 that we consider very relevant and of high quality. Let&rsquo;s jump right into it!</p>\n<h2>Jack Dorsey: perseverance pays off</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQy_HFHOZug\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>Jack Dorsey&rsquo;s fingerprints are all over the place in recent years. <span class=\"default-blue\">He was part of the original team that built Twitter while working at podcasting company Odeo and, after being fired as CEO of Twitter, he went to co-found another billion dollar startup, Square.</span></p>\n<p>The interview above with Kevin Rose is one of Dorsey&rsquo;s best and, although he does not talk about all of the issues that took place inside Twitter while trying to transform the startup into a big company -for more details on that read <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hatching-Twitter-Story-Friendship-Betrayal/dp/1591846013\">Hatching Twitter</a>&ndash; he does go into detail about his childhood, how his passion for maps and urban city helped him come up with the idea of Twitter and how a variety of other situations helped him build <a href=\"https://startupxplore.com/en/blog/fintech-startups-europe/\">payments</a> company Square. Dorsey&rsquo;s has had its up and downs during his career, but if there&rsquo;s one thing we can learn from him is that <strong>perseverance pays off in the long run</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Fred Wilson: corporate VCs suck</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-gaG7iTBIw\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">Fred Wilson has become one of the most legendary venture capitalists in the US.</span> He co-founded NYC-based <a href=\"http://www.usv.com/\">Union Square Ventures</a> in the 90s and since then he&rsquo;s invested in some of the fastest growing startups out of Silicon Valley and New York City: Twitter, Zynga, Foursquare, Tumblr, etsy, etc. Wilson regularly shares his thoughts on the venture capital and technology industry on his blog, <a href=\"http://avc.com/\">avc</a>, and he&rsquo;s algo been interviewed a number of times at various events and conferences. However, the above with Sarah Lacy from Pando is probably on his best.</p>\n<p>For an hour and a half Wilson discusses the changes happening in the VC industry, his experience and his legacy. Oh, and also why <strong>he does not like to co-invest with corporate VCs</strong>. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never invest with corporate VCs again. Never, ever, ever again. Because they suck. They&rsquo;re not interested in the company or entrepreneur success, they&rsquo;re interested in their own success and they suck at investing. There are exceptions like Intel and Google, but most of the rest suck&rdquo;.</p>\n<h2>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs: compete and cooperate</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvhW8cp15tk\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>The technology industry, in many ways, it&rsquo;s ultra competitive. Startups fight against each other to become market leaders in their areas and to control the profits. However, this does not mean that technology companies can&rsquo;t help each other and cooperate. One of the best examples of this was Microsoft&rsquo;s $150 million investment in Apple, when the company founded by Steve Jobs was struggling and on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">At the AllThingsD conference, Jobs and Gates were interviewed by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg and looked back on the 80s and 90s, when both Apple and Microsoft were starting to become a force in the market.</span> Should companies compete against each other ferociously? No doubt. <strong>Can they also help each other and cooperate in favor of the market and consumers? Also possible.</strong></p>\n<h2>Martin Varsavsky: life-work balance</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GB10ilqE6sw\"></iframe></figure>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">Born in Argentina, grew up in New York and developed his professional career in Madrid, Spain.</span> <span class=\"default-blue\">The story of Martin Varsavsky is full of changes and interesting anecdotes, and his success at building massive companies such as Jazztel or Ya.com once again demonstrate that immigrants tend to be among the most successful entrepreneurs.</span> Since 2005 he&rsquo;s embarked in a new adventure, Fon, a Madrid-based company that wants to become the biggest WiFi network in the world. However, life is not only about work and Varsavsky has said so a number of times in the past few years.</p>\n<p>In the above presentation that he gave at LeWeb London 2012, the Argentinian-turned-Spaniard shares a variety of tips and recommendations from <strong>those who want to work better and, in the meantime, have a better life</strong>. Quick tip from from: don&rsquo;t pay much attention to the recommendation of owning your own plane. Achieving that is not an easy task.</p>\n<h2>Sergei Brin and Larry Page: long term vision</h2>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wdnp_7atZ0M\"></iframe></figure>\n<p>This one is very recent. It&rsquo;s not easy to see Sergei Brin and Larry Page share the stage for an interview, but they did so in the summer of 2014 at the KV Summit, a conference led by venture capitalist Vinod Khosla. It&rsquo;s not a long interview and very easy to digest, but Bring and Page talk about something that most people know about Google but that has not been made public many times in the past: <strong>the company&rsquo;s long term vision</strong>. Both co-founders claim that, contrary to most other technology companies, they have the luxury of working on a long term vision, thinking 10 to 20 years ahead instead of the usual four. Can other companies do this? The bigger ones do. Do they all do it? Unfortunately not.</p>",

In the past few years, we&rsquo;ve doubled in size&mdash;today, we have more than 100,000 employees in 170 cities spanning nearly 60 countries. Operating at this scale brings an elevated level of responsibility to everything we do&mdash;including a workforce that's more representative of our users, and a workplace that creates a sense of belonging for everyone.</p>\n<p>Thank you for joining us on this journey.</p>\n<p>OUR COMMITMENTS TO</p>\n<h2> Our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion </h2>\n<p>As Google continues to grow, we have a responsibility to scale our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to increase pathways to tech in the communities we call home. Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re approaching that work.</p>\n<p>We are building a robust, diverse talent pool to support our industry&rsquo;s growth. By providing computer science education from primary school through university we are growing the next generation of Black and Latinx tech leaders through programs like <a href=\"https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home\">CS First</a>, <a href=\"https://codenext.withgoogle.com/\">Code Next</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/diversity/tech-exchange-students/\">Tech Exchange</a>. Our residency programs like <a href=\"https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/itrp/\">IT Residency Program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/engres.html\">Engineering Residency</a>, and <a href=\"https://research.google/careers/ai-residency/\">AI Residency</a>, help jumpstart careers in technology at Google and beyond.</p>\n<p>Google works hard to attract the best talent and once they are here, we want them to stay. To support this, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion capabilities among all Googlers from managers and leaders, to front line human resources. The Equity Programs Team focuses on ensuring parity in how we source and hire Nooglers as well as in performance reviews, promotions, and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/perspectives/melonie-parker/how-retention-helps-make-google-more-representative/\">retention</a>. Through our <a href=\"https://diversity.google/commitments/\">Employee Resource Groups</a>, Leadership Councils, and Diversity councils, we foster a sense of belonging throughout the company, even while many of us are <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/diversity/how-foster-inclusion-while-working-home/\">working from home</a>.</p>\n<p>Responsible growth means looking beyond the demands of our industry, to consider how our work impacts the cities, sites, and countries where we operate. We approach this work by building long-term partnerships with educational institutions, policymakers, and community organizations. <a href=\"https://www.google.org/\">Google.org</a> is committed to philanthropy in support of STEM access for underserved communities. Grow With Google&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://grow.google/digitalcoaches/\">Digital Coaches</a> provide digital skills training and coaching to help Black and Latinx small businesses grow.</p>",

Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re leading at Google, supporting partners, and enabling everyone to be part of the solution to climate change.</p>\n<h2>Leading at Google</h2>\n<p>We always start with how we can operate our business more sustainably. It&rsquo;s our responsibility - and it&rsquo;s also the best way to innovate, iterate, and share best practices with others. </p>\n<h3>Operating on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;re proud that we were the first major company to reach carbon neutrality and have become one of the world&rsquo;s largest corporate buyers of renewable energy. But we know we must push further to confront the magnitude of today&rsquo;s climate challenge. <span class=\"default-blue\">Now, we aim to be the first major company to achieve 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.</span></p>\n<p>To get there, we&rsquo;re pursuing new <a href=\"https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/\">carbon-free energy</a> generation and storage technologies. We&rsquo;ll continue our work with governments, utilities, and policymakers to deploy those technologies and drive system-level change. And as we learn more about the best ways to move towards our goal, we hope to demonstrate that a fully decarbonized future is achievable for <em>everyone</em>.</p>\n<p>In 2007, we were the first major company to commit to carbon neutrality, and since 2017 we&rsquo;ve matched 100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases. So what about those years between <a href=\"https://about.google/our-story/\">1998</a> and 2006? Good question. As of today, we&rsquo;ve procured enough high-quality carbon offsets to neutralize all of our emissions since our founding.</p>\n<h3>Deploy $5.75B in sustainability bonds</h3>\n<p>Sustainability bonds are increasingly-important tools that drive investment in environmental and social initiatives worldwide. This August, <a href=\"https://blog.google/alphabet/alphabet-issues-sustainability-bonds-support-environmental-and-social-initiatives/\">we issued $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds</a>. It&rsquo;s the largest corporate issuance of its kind, ever.</p>\n<p>These investments will ramp up support for a wide variety of issues vital to a sustainable future - clean energy, green buildings, clean transportation, circular design, affordable housing, racial equity, COVID-19 response, and support for small businesses, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>Carbon-free energy is hard to source in many parts of the world, including in some of our key manufacturing regions. To help drive development of wind, solar, and other clean energy generation where it&rsquo;s needed most, we&rsquo;re building on our previous <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/hardware-sustainability-progress/\">investment </a>to bring a total of five gigawatts online over the next ten years. That's more than all the solar capacity available in the state of Arizona today.</p>\n<h2>Supporting Partners</h2>\n<p>Deleting emissions from our own operations is vital, but our impact is far greater when we enable others to do the same. We&rsquo;re committed to sharing technology, methods, and funding to help organizations everywhere transition to resilient, carbon-free systems. </p>\n<p>Half of Earth&rsquo;s population lives in cities. Seventy percent of emissions originate in cities. <a href=\"https://insights.sustainability.google/\">Environmental Insights Explorer</a> already helps a hundred cities understand their emissions and solar potential more clearly. We&rsquo;re making that data available to 3,000 cities, helping them to measure, plan, and track progress towards their climate action plans. This creates a quicker pathway to better air quality and new green jobs, with a goal of emissions reductions equivalent to taking 200 million cars off the road for a year.</p>\n<h3>Remove more carbon from the atmosphere with reforestation and better tree data</h3>\n<p>Efficiency and clean energy are vital, but we also need to remove carbon that&rsquo;s already in the air. Nature provides a great solution - trees - but knowing where, when, and what to plant is critical to ensure planted trees thrive and have the desired effect of restoring lands and communities.</p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re starting with our own science-based reforestation efforts in California, Texas, Spain, and Australia. We&rsquo;re also partnering with Crowther Lab to develop a global data platform to increase the impact of restoration projects around the world, enabling others to come on this journey.</p>\n<p>The<a href=\"https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/climate2020\"> Google.org Impact Challenge on Climate</a> commits &euro;10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe&rsquo;s progress toward a greener, more resilient future. Selected organizations may receive up to &euro;2M in funding and possible customized post-grant support from the Google for Startups Accelerator to help bring their ideas to life.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough AI research to dramatically increase building efficiency</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-data-centre-cooling-bill-40\">2016</a>, Google and DeepMind started using machine learning to control the cooling systems in our global data centers. Those algorithms now work <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/safety-first-ai-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control\">safely and autonomously</a> to bring a 30% energy savings to our cooling systems, in our most energy-intense buildings. Pretty cool, but just a start.</p>\n<p>Now, we&rsquo;ve developed the Industrial Adaptive Controls platform to deliver AI-enabled energy savings on a global scale. We will make these solutions available to the largest industrial enterprises and Building Management software providers. These software providers collectively make up nearly 60% of the global large commercial building footprint. Now that&rsquo;s efficiency at planetary scale.</p>\n<h2>Enabling Everyone</h2>\n<p>Google helps people around the world take action to live more sustainably every day. People searched for &ldquo;How to live a more sustainable lifestyle&rdquo; more than ever in 2020. And some of our products are already helping people around the world take steps to do just that. They turn to Google Maps to find sustainable transit options like walking, biking, and public transportation. <span class=\"default-blue\">And Nest Thermostats have helped customers save 50 billion kWh of energy over the years.</span> But we know there&rsquo;s more we can do to help everyone live more sustainably. </p>\n<h3>Offer 1 billion people new ways to take actions to reduce their environmental footprint by 2022</h3>\n<p>We&rsquo;re building products and technology that empower people to better understand their personal impact and reduce their carbon footprint. Over the next two years, we&rsquo;ll build features that connect people with more sustainable options and offer actionable information at the right time. Our goal is to help a billion people reduce their environmental footprint each year by introducing new sustainability features directly into our core products. We&rsquo;ve already started this journey: we added CO₂ emission estimates, and the ability to sort by emissions, for some flights in Europe in Google Flights. We&rsquo;ve also added carbon-neutral shipping and highlighting of sustainable items in Google Shopping. And there&rsquo;s a lot more coming soon.</p>",

From Apple, <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/amazon/\">Amazon</a>, Facebook to Netflix to the ubiquitous search engine <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a>, we are slowly getting hooked on to their products and services all across the country. But, as an investor in the Indian stock market, have you ever given a thought to owning the shares of these global giants?</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Global leaders such as Facebook, Google, Netflix, Apple, etc. have users across the world, including India. As a customer of a company that&rsquo;s doing well, there&rsquo;s a natural urge to want to include them in your portfolio, and benefit from their growth,&rdquo; says Prateek Mehta, Co-Founder and Chief Business Officer, Scripbox.</p>\n<p>In fact, there are innumerable international brands that we use in India but not all could be listed on NSE or BSE. Surely, the thought of investing in international companies must have crossed your mind, but the ways and means to go about investing in the US stocks could have been a deterrent.</p>\n<p>Of late, more and more Indian investors are latching on to the opportunities available in the US markets. &ldquo;Investing in US stocks has been all the rage recently and with good reason, &ldquo;says Prateek. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">The Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google (GOOGL) stocks are collectively referred to as FAANG stocks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Remember, the US Fed&rsquo;s liquidity programme to tackle economic woes back in 2020 and the work-from-home environment has a big role to play in the global asset prices. Fed is expected to keep taking steps to help bring back economy to shape. And, with US economy back on track, the US stocks are expected to be the lead runners of the next bull run.</p>\n<p>Besides this, the reason to geographically diversify one&rsquo;s portfolio into global stocks is a strong enough reason to bring stability and high risk-adjusted return in your portfolio.</p>\n<p>If you are looking to invest abroad, there&rsquo;s international brokerage platforms that can give you the access to US stock market. Once you open a foreign trading account, stocks and ETFs listed on the leading US indices such as Nasdaq, DOW 30 or the S&amp;P 500 will just be a click-away. &ldquo;We have recently partnered with Stockal, a global investing platform, to offer US stocks to our customers. We had been offering US equity based mutual funds as a solution previously. However, with this new partnership, users can invest conveniently from their Scripbox accounts in stocks of leading global companies listed in the US stock exchange, along with Index ETFs,&rdquo; informs Prateek.</p>\n<p>But, is it too complicated and complex to begin with? &ldquo;Simplified regulatory norms have made it possible for investors to seek diversification towards international mutual funds and stocks for their wealth diversification needs. Companies like Stockal have further simplified the process, from guiding customers on KYC related concerns to providing customer care in local (Indian) time zones. For us at Scripbox, as a full stack wealth management service, our role has been to partner with our customers for their wealth creation needs, and through our partnership with Stockal, we&rsquo;re able to bring this additional investment avenue to them,&rdquo; says Prateek.</p>\n<p>Jumping on to the US stocks need to be a well-crafted affair. Allocating some portion towards US stocks can help you bring in the diversification to your portfolio. Adding global leaders in their respective industries to your stock portfolio can be something you don&rsquo;t want to miss on. You can start with large-cap individual stocks or with ETFs tracking Nasdaq or the S&amp;P 500 indexes. Whether you are a trader or a long term investor, the money making opportunities are in plenty in the US stock market.</p>\n<p>However, akin to all stock market investing, there are inherent risks to investing in US stocks. &ldquo;While investing in international markets does have a number of benefits, such as portfolio diversification and superior returns, there is an element of risk as well. A good wealth manager can advise on whether your portfolio would benefit from investing in international equities,&rdquo; adds Prateek.</p>",

For $64.99, you&rsquo;ll get both the Chromecast with Google TV and three months of HBO Max. The device usually retails for $49.99, and HBO Max&rsquo;s ad-free tier <a href=\"http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&aff_id=1&source=Verge&aff_sub=GoogleChromecast072021\">costs $14.99 per month</a>, so you&rsquo;re basically getting two months of the service for free.</p>\n<p>As usual with this sort of thing, the deal is only available for new subscribers of HBO Max; existing customers are out of luck. Google is offering the bundle beginning today, and it&rsquo;ll be available for the rest of the year.

And it has curves. &ldquo;Does it really need an invisible ghost wearing it?&rdquo; asks Jennifer Daniel, Google&rsquo;s creative director of emoji, in a press release.</p>\n<figure><video> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_webm/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/2g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji-Bikini.gif\" type=\"video/webm\"></source> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_mp4/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/2g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji-Bikini.gif\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source> </video><figcaption>[Image: Google]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The new update deflates the invisible woman inside, and portrays a 2D bikini that appears to be lying on a surface instead. It&rsquo;s a subtle but important update. While the invisible woman emoji depicted a specific body type, a bikini lying flat is just a generic bikini. It&rsquo;s whatever you make of a bikini&mdash;the exact sort of generalization at the heart of how all emoji are supposed to work.</p>\n<figure><video> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_webm/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/10g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji.gif\" type=\"video/webm\"></source> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_mp4/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/10g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji.gif\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source> </video><figcaption>[Images: Google]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s other big update is around Dark Mode&mdash;swapping bright white pages with black type for black backgrounds with white type&mdash;which is extremely popular on smartphones, and polls show that as many as <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/dark-mode-poll-results-1090716/\">82% of Android users</a> have adopted this feature. The mode allows modern phones to burn through less battery, while lowering the lumens pushed on your eyes, which is far more comfortable if you read in bed at night.</p>\n<figure><video> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_webm/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/16g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji.gif\" type=\"video/webm\"></source> <source src=\"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_mp4/wp-cms/uploads/2021/07/16g-90656129-the-three-surprises-of-googleand8217s-new-emoji.gif\" type=\"video/mp4\"></source> </video><figcaption>[Images: Google]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For the most part, background color doesn&rsquo;t affect emoji because their backgrounds are transparent. But Google is experimenting with some emoji that change their appearance specifically for Dark Mode. The first example Google has shared is its new Camping emoji (the other new Dark Mode emoji include a Rocket, Three Mountains, and a UFO). In regular mode, Google has added a sun over the camping tent. In Dark Mode, you&rsquo;ll see a moon and stars. It&rsquo;s a decision that is more playful than functional&mdash;reminding us that, while there is a lot of serious, ongoing work around <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90343461/google-releases-gender-fluid-emoji\">topics of representation and inclusion</a> happening within the emojiverse, its creators are still taking the time to have fun with the medium just for the heck of it.</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/573224898?dnt=1&app_id=122963\" width=\"525\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>At Microsoft: 3D office party!</h2>\n<p>Over at Microsoft, the company is completely overhauling its emoji in a massive update that will arrive later this year. Microsoft is known for having some of the flattest emoji of all, drawn with thick outlines to increase legibility. Now, Microsoft is embracing maximalism and big personality.</p>\n<p>Its new emoji are 3D, and most are animated. The face emoji almost look like claymation because all the heads have been purposefully created with an imperfect circle. &ldquo;People aren&rsquo;t perfect, so why should our graphical representations be?&rdquo; writes Claire Anderson, Art Director &amp; Emojiologist at Microsoft, in a press release.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>[Image: Microsoft Design]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I&rsquo;m totally in love with the little guys! They look downright cinematic, like the world of emoji was remade through a Pixar-level production process. <span class=\"default-blue\">The Microsoft mascot Clippy, who will be the new paper clip emoji, has never looked better.</span></p>\n<figure><figcaption>[Image: Microsoft Design]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Microsoft has also planted a strong flag in the comic tone of its emoji. Yes, there are zany faces. But Microsoft also shared several concept sketches that depict remote work through humor. One emoji features a woman dancing with a jacket and no pants, while another features a taped-over webcam. &ldquo;Maybe the vulnerability or levity of emoji can not only open up our own creativity but also encourage space and agency for others in our organization,&rdquo; Anderson writes.</p>\n<figure><figcaption>[Images: Microsoft Design]</figcaption></figure>\n<p>But what about Microsoft&rsquo;s old approach to emoji, which featured bold black strokes, optimizing accessibility for the sight-impaired? Anderson doesn&rsquo;t comment about it in the announcement, but the new emoji make liberal use of layers and shadows, which should still help with legibility, albeit in a subtler way. As of right now, Microsoft seems to have developed the picture-perfect modern update for emoji that were first designed for a 25-year-old Softbank phone.</p>",

More than 70 percent of worldwide online search requests are handled by Google, placing it at the heart of most <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet\">Internet</a> users&rsquo; experience. Its headquarters are in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Mountain-View-California\">Mountain View</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state\">California</a>.</p>\n<p>Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-mail\">e-mail</a> and online document creation to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/software\">software</a> for <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone\">mobile phones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/tablet-computer\">tablet computers</a>. <span class=\"default-blue\">In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put it in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones.</span> Google&rsquo;s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apple-Inc\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation\">IBM</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation\">Microsoft</a>. Despite this <a data-term=\"myriad\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myriad\">myriad</a> of products, its original search tool remains the core of its success. In 2016 Alphabet earned nearly all of its revenue from Google <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/advertising\">advertising</a> based on users&rsquo; search requests.</p>\n<h2>Searching for business</h2>\n<p>Brin and Page, who met as graduate students at <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University\">Stanford University</a>, were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page&rsquo;s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage Web users&rsquo; own ranking abilities by tracking each <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Web-site\">Web site&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;backing links&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the number of other pages linked to them. Most search engines simply returned a list of Web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each Web site had; i.e., a Web site with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities. Further, a link from a heavily linked Web site would be a more valuable &ldquo;vote&rdquo; than one from a more obscure Web site.</p>\n<p>In mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing (one of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc\">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Menlo-Park-California\">Menlo Park</a>, California, under the name Google, which was derived from a misspelling of Page&rsquo;s original planned name, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/googol\"><em>googol</em></a> (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of venture capital funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day.</span></span> Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web&rsquo;s most popular sites, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yahoo-Inc\">Yahoo!</a>. By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google&rsquo;s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued: by the end of 2011 Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company&rsquo;s name became so <a data-term=\"ubiquitous\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquitous\">ubiquitous</a> that it entered the lexicon as a verb: <em>to google</em> became a common expression for searching the Internet.</p>\n<p>To accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centres around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/multiprocessing\">multiprocessor</a> personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). Google&rsquo;s interlinked computers probably number several million. The heart of Google&rsquo;s operation, however, is built around three <a data-term=\"proprietary\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proprietary\">proprietary</a> pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; across several machines; Bigtable is the company&rsquo;s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; &ldquo;theatre,&rdquo; and &ldquo;participatory&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>The extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eric-Schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a> as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who previously had held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science\">computer science</a> and melded well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt&rsquo;s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a &ldquo;triumvirate&rdquo; until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s initial public offering (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to Standard and Poor&rsquo;s 500 (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/SandP-500\">S&amp;P 500</a>) stock index in 2006. In 2012 Google&rsquo;s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dow-Jones-average\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>.</p>\n<p>Google reorganized itself in <a data-term=\"August\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/August\">August</a> 2015 to become a subsidiary of the holding company <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/Alphabet-Inc\">Alphabet Inc.</a> Internet search, advertising, apps, and maps, as well as the mobile <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system\">operating system</a> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Android-operating-system\">Android</a> and the video-sharing site <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/YouTube\">YouTube</a>, remained under Google. Separate Google ventures&mdash;such as longevity research company Calico, home-products company Nest, and research lab Google X&mdash;became separate firms under Alphabet. <span class=\"default-blue\">Page became CEO of Alphabet, Brin its president, and Schmidt its executive chairman.</span> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sundar-Pichai\">Sundar Pichai</a>, senior vice president of products, became Google&rsquo;s new CEO. Alphabet again reorganized in 2017 to create an intermediate holding company, XXVI Holdings, and to convert Google into a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/limited-liability\">limited liability</a> company (LLC). In 2018 Schmidt stepped down as executive chairman. More changes followed in 2019 as both Brin and Page left their posts as president and CEO, respectively. However, they both remained on Alphabet&rsquo;s board of directors. <span class=\"default-blue\">Pichai became CEO of the holding company while retaining that position at Google.</span></p>\n<figure data-assembly-id=\"232342\"><figcaption><a data-href=\"/media/1/1017491/232342\" href=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/20/193820-050-45614DA7/Sundar-Pichai-2015.jpg\">Sundar Pichai</a></figcaption></figure>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/advertising\">Advertising</a> growth</h2>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s strong financial results reflected the rapid growth of Internet advertising in general and Google&rsquo;s popularity in particular. Analysts attributed part of that success to a shift in advertising spending toward the Internet and away from traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, and television. For example, American newspaper advertising fell from a peak of $64 billion in 2000 to $20.7 billion in 2011, while global online advertising grew from approximately $6 billion in 2000 to more than $72 billion in 2011.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, Google has spent large sums to secure what it has calculated to be significant Internet <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/marketing\">marketing</a> advantages. <span class=\"default-blue\">For example, in 2003 Google spent $102 million to acquire Applied Semantics, the makers of AdSense, a service that signed up owners of Web sites to run various types of ads on their Web pages.</span> In 2006 Google again paid $102 million for another Web advertisement business, dMarc Broadcasting, and that same year it announced that it would pay $900 million over three and a half years for the right to sell ads on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Myspace\">MySpace.com</a>. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">In 2007 Google made its largest acquisition to date, buying online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.</span></span> <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">Two years later the company responded to the explosive growth of the mobile applications market with a $750 million deal to acquire the mobile advertising network AdMob.</span></span> All of these purchases were part of Google&rsquo;s effort to expand from its search engine business into advertising by combining the various firms&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/database\">databases</a> of information in order to tailor ads to consumers&rsquo; individual preferences.</p>",

Hard to say. Especially now when texting has become a part of our daily routine, not using emojis while chatting with someone could feel dull and boring. Emoji helps us communicate feelings, words, expressions which are hard to put in words or which could otherwise be not formulated or put in words. Infact, emojis have made communication much better and easier on social media platforms&ndash; Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, where we can&rsquo;t always respond to people in words or sentences. This day marks the objective to promote the usage of emojis in our day-to-day conversations.</p>\n<p><strong>World Emoji Day: History and Significance</strong></p>\n<p><span class=\"default-blue\">The first emoji was created by an engineer, Shigetaka Kurita, in Japanese mobile operating company back in 1999.</span> <span class=\"default-blue\">Shigetaka created some 176 emojis for the release of a mobile integrated service i-mode.</span> <span class=\"default-blue\">Unicode finally approved the standardised usage of emoji in 2010.</span> It was only after then, global giants like <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/google/\">Google</a>, Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/tag/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a> and Twitter started creating their own sets of emojis. <span class=\"default-blue\">In 2014, the founder of Emojipedia, Jeremy Burge announced that July 17 will be recognised as World Emoji Day every year.</span></p>\n<p><strong>The most used emojis</strong></p>\n<p>As per the blog published by the World Economic Forum last year, emojis have been used nearly 5 billion times every day on social media platforms Facebook and FB messenger alone. It is a huge number. The report also states that in 1995 the number of emojis present were just 76. By 2020, that number has grown exponentially to 3,136. Some of the emojis were used more than the others. This emoji, crying with laughter, was the most used emoji on social platforms Twitter and Facebook. On Instagram, the most used emoji was a heart emoji.</p>\n<p><strong>New emojis on the way!</strong></p>\n<p>Yes! You heard it right. After a slight delay due to the ongoing pandemic, new sets of emojis are on their way for Android and iOS users. The draft list for the new emojis have been announced yesterday, July 16 for Emoji 14.0 update. The list includes emojis like&ndash;saluting face, melting smiley face, biting lip, pregnant people, multicolor handshakes among others. The final list of emojis is expected to be finalised by Unicode in September and is scheduled to be rolled out to different devices in 2022.</p>\n<p><strong>&lsquo;Soundemoji&rsquo; soon</strong></p>\n<p>The other day Facebook announced that it will be soon rolling out emojis with sound on its messaging platform&ndash;Facebook messenger &ldquo;Soundemoji&rdquo;. <span class=\"default-blue\">The company also stated that Soundemoji will let its users send short sound clips, such as clapping, drumoll, and evil laughter, while chatting on Facebook Messenger.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Who approves the emojis?</strong><br>\nThe final approval for the emojis that we use daily comes by the Unicode Consortium after which the emojis are published and widely used by mobile operating systems&ndash;Android and iOS users on their respective platforms. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">The Unicode Consortium (California based non-profit organisation) has members (Netflix, Apple, facebook, Google, Tinder) who vote and submit their take on the emojis awaiting approval.</span></span></span></p>",

(1998&ndash;2017)</strong>, American <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/search-engine\">search engine</a> company, founded in 1998 by <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sergey-Brin\">Sergey Brin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Larry-Page\">Larry Page</a>, that is a subsidiary of the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/holding-company\">holding company</a> Alphabet Inc. More than 70 percent of worldwide online search requests are handled by Google, placing it at the heart of most <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet\">Internet</a> users&rsquo; experience. Its headquarters are in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Mountain-View-California\">Mountain View</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state\">California</a>.</p>\n<p>Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-mail\">e-mail</a> and online document creation to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/software\">software</a> for <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone\">mobile phones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/tablet-computer\">tablet computers</a>. <span class=\"default-blue\">In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put it in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones.</span> Google&rsquo;s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apple-Inc\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation\">IBM</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation\">Microsoft</a>. Despite this <a data-term=\"myriad\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myriad\">myriad</a> of products, its original search tool remains the core of its success. In 2016 Alphabet earned nearly all of its revenue from Google <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/advertising\">advertising</a> based on users&rsquo; search requests.</p>\n<h2>Searching for business</h2>\n<p>Brin and Page, who met as graduate students at <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University\">Stanford University</a>, were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page&rsquo;s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage Web users&rsquo; own ranking abilities by tracking each <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Web-site\">Web site&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;backing links&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the number of other pages linked to them. Most search engines simply returned a list of Web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each Web site had; i.e., a Web site with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities. Further, a link from a heavily linked Web site would be a more valuable &ldquo;vote&rdquo; than one from a more obscure Web site.</p>\n<p>In mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing (one of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc\">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Menlo-Park-California\">Menlo Park</a>, California, under the name Google, which was derived from a misspelling of Page&rsquo;s original planned name, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/googol\"><em>googol</em></a> (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of venture capital funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day.</span></span> Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web&rsquo;s most popular sites, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yahoo-Inc\">Yahoo!</a>. By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google&rsquo;s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued: by the end of 2011 Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company&rsquo;s name became so <a data-term=\"ubiquitous\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquitous\">ubiquitous</a> that it entered the lexicon as a verb: <em>to google</em> became a common expression for searching the Internet.</p>\n<p>To accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centres around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/multiprocessing\">multiprocessor</a> personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). Google&rsquo;s interlinked computers probably number several million. The heart of Google&rsquo;s operation, however, is built around three <a data-term=\"proprietary\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proprietary\">proprietary</a> pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in &ldquo;chunks&rdquo; across several machines; Bigtable is the company&rsquo;s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words &ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; &ldquo;theatre,&rdquo; and &ldquo;participatory&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>The extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eric-Schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a> as chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who previously had held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science\">computer science</a> and melded well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt&rsquo;s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a &ldquo;triumvirate&rdquo; until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.</p>\n<p>The company&rsquo;s initial public offering (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to Standard and Poor&rsquo;s 500 (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/SandP-500\">S&amp;P 500</a>) stock index in 2006. In 2012 Google&rsquo;s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dow-Jones-average\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>.</p>\n<p>Google reorganized itself in <a data-term=\"August\" href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/August\">August</a> 2015 to become a subsidiary of the holding company <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/animal/Alphabet-Inc\">Alphabet Inc.</a> Internet search, advertising, apps, and maps, as well as the mobile <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/operating-system\">operating system</a> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/Android-operating-system\">Android</a> and the video-sharing site <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/YouTube\">YouTube</a>, remained under Google. Separate Google ventures&mdash;such as longevity research company Calico, home-products company Nest, and research lab Google X&mdash;became separate firms under Alphabet. <span class=\"default-blue\">Page became CEO of Alphabet, Brin its president, and Schmidt its executive chairman.</span> <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sundar-Pichai\">Sundar Pichai</a>, senior vice president of products, became Google&rsquo;s new CEO. Alphabet again reorganized in 2017 to create an intermediate holding company, XXVI Holdings, and to convert Google into a <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/limited-liability\">limited liability</a> company (LLC). In 2018 Schmidt stepped down as executive chairman. More changes followed in 2019 as both Brin and Page left their posts as president and CEO, respectively. However, they both remained on Alphabet&rsquo;s board of directors. <span class=\"default-blue\">Pichai became CEO of the holding company while retaining that position at Google.</span></p>\n<figure data-assembly-id=\"232342\"><figcaption><a data-href=\"/media/1/1017491/232342\" href=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/20/193820-050-45614DA7/Sundar-Pichai-2015.jpg\">Sundar Pichai</a></figcaption></figure>\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/advertising\">Advertising</a> growth</h2>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s strong financial results reflected the rapid growth of Internet advertising in general and Google&rsquo;s popularity in particular. Analysts attributed part of that success to a shift in advertising spending toward the Internet and away from traditional media, including newspapers, magazines, and television. For example, American newspaper advertising fell from a peak of $64 billion in 2000 to $20.7 billion in 2011, while global online advertising grew from approximately $6 billion in 2000 to more than $72 billion in 2011.</p>\n<p>Since its founding, Google has spent large sums to secure what it has calculated to be significant Internet <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/marketing\">marketing</a> advantages. <span class=\"default-blue\">For example, in 2003 Google spent $102 million to acquire Applied Semantics, the makers of AdSense, a service that signed up owners of Web sites to run various types of ads on their Web pages.</span> In 2006 Google again paid $102 million for another Web advertisement business, dMarc Broadcasting, and that same year it announced that it would pay $900 million over three and a half years for the right to sell ads on <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Myspace\">MySpace.com</a>. <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">In 2007 Google made its largest acquisition to date, buying online advertising firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion.</span></span> <span class=\"default-blue\"><span class=\"default-blue\">Two years later the company responded to the explosive growth of the mobile applications market with a $750 million deal to acquire the mobile advertising network AdMob.</span></span> All of these purchases were part of Google&rsquo;s effort to expand from its search engine business into advertising by combining the various firms&rsquo; <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/database\">databases</a> of information in order to tailor ads to consumers&rsquo; individual preferences.</p>",
